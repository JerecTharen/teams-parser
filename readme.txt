Meant to be an .NET core application to parse through my works memes and music teams channel to find and keep track of music links

Currently researching on getting the api set up with teams

To set up, use "dotnet run"

.NET core documentation: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/get-started?tabs=linux
